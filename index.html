    <h1>Hello World -- This is my website! I like to play video games and draw</h1>

This was the very first time I'd done any serious kind of video editing. To be honest,
I wasn't very confident in how it would turn out, eventhough it wasn't supposed to be the very
best being that it was the beginning of the semester, but for what I did I feel that I did a decent job.

  This was the first time we were able to experiment with Premier and it was actually a little
  intimidating at first, I had a lot of trouble with this becuase I was trying to adjust back into schoo life
  as well as my new device, but it was pretty fun to learn how some of my favorite vloggers and Youtubers
  do their video editing.

    During my course I was required to edit a piece of video and present what it'd be like as an installation.
    What I did was supposed to be a somewhat personal piece, I am battling with anxiety which often leads me to
    want to stay inside constantly, so I thought to make a film on what my 'day' usually is like when I pretty
    much have no courage to leave.

  This was my final submission to the course and honestly this was the most fun I'd had while making it. It was of course
  exhausting to get the footage I needed, sitting for long periods can be a pain but it was very liberating. A lot of the time
  I don't have much fun playing but when I stream (which is what all the pieces of footage are from) I feel happier
  cause I like to make people laugh, and nothing makes me laugh more than silly streamers. So I'm really glad
  that I took this course because I learned a lot about film editing magic.

My name is Timberlee Spencer and I am an aspiring Illustrator/animator. I've loved art since I was
a child and have always wanted to run my own studio and publish a graphic novel, I have had many ups
and downs with my passions though a lot of them struggling with my own self worth in my art but I
am slowly working on that and pushing myself towards my goal. As a means to expand my horizons I took this
course as a way to learn how to make my own videos if and when I get to that point in my goal, it'll prove to
be valuable knowledge that can be applied to a spectrum of paths, it's just a matter of me finding the road to them.

Taking this course was a journey to say the least. I know I tripped a lot along the way but I still managed to scrape by
  which I'm proud of myself cause there were times I thought it would be easier to just give up, but then I'd be more upset
  over the fact that I gave up instead of seeing what awaited at the end. From the beginning to the end of the semester it was
  and interesting experience and it was incredibly fun. I feel like what I've learned along the way can be very useful down the
    line.
