This was the very first time I'd done any serious kind of video editing. To be honest,
I wasn't very confident in how it would turn out, eventhough it wasn't supposed to be the very
best being that it was the beginning of the semester, but for what I did I feel that I did a decent job.

  This was the first time we were able to experiment with Premier and it was actually a little
  intimidating at first, I had a lot of trouble with this becuase I was trying to adjust back into schoo life
  as well as my new device, but it was pretty fun to learn how some of my favorite vloggers and Youtubers
  do their video editing.

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UEDYKBMtjA" Installation Project </a></p>
    During my course I was required to edit a piece of video and present what it'd be like as an installation.
    What I did was supposed to be a somewhat personal piece, I am battling with anxiety which often leads me to
    want to stay inside constantly, so I thought to make a film on what my 'day' usually is like when I pretty
    much have no courage to leave.

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fI5v-Vu2ETQ" Final Project </a></p>
  This was my final submission to the course and honestly this was the most fun I'd had while making it. It was of course
  exhausting to get the footage I needed, sitting for long periods can be a pain but it was very liberating. A lot of the time
  I don't have much fun playing but when I stream (which is what all the pieces of footage are from) I feel happier
  cause I like to make people laugh, and nothing makes me laugh more than silly streamers. So I'm really glad
  that I took this course because I learned a lot about film editing magic.
